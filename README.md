    <section>
        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('stance')">My Current Stance &#9660;</h2>
        <div class="content" id="stance">
            <p>When I first began using large language models (LLMs), I did not fully understand the impact they could have on both my academic journey and my personal outlook on technology. At the time, my use of these tools was motivated by convenience. I was a busy student, often juggling multiple assignments, exams, and outside commitments, and the appeal of being able to quickly get answers was undeniable. Instead of spending an hour working through a problem set or struggling to understand a concept from my textbook, I could simply type a question into an LLM and receive a polished response within seconds. At first, I thought this was incredible—it felt like having a tutor on call twenty-four hours a day. But the reality was that I wasn’t using the model as a tutor at all. I was treating it as a shortcut. I didn’t ask it to teach me or explain the material in detail. I asked it for the answers, and then I copied them down.</p>
            <p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that this way of using LLMs was hurting me. I would ace small assignments and feel good about it, but when bigger exams came along, I was unprepared. I had skipped the process of really learning the material, and so the knowledge never stuck. My dependency on LLMs had replaced the struggle, and while struggle isn’t fun, it is an important part of learning. When I began to notice this pattern, I decided I needed to change my approach. Instead of seeing the LLM as a replacement for my effort, I started treating it as a teaching tool. Now, when I use it, I ask it to explain step by step, or I ask it to compare multiple approaches to the same problem. I’ll often ask follow-up questions, the same way I would if I were talking to a professor during office hours. This change in mindset has helped me regain control of my learning process. I now use the model as a supplement, not as a crutch, and that has made me a stronger student.</p>
            <p>Even though I have learned to use LLMs in a healthier way, I cannot ignore the broader concerns they raise, particularly in relation to my future career in software engineering. One of my biggest worries is that LLMs could reduce the demand for engineers in the job market. These models are capable of producing code, generating solutions, and assisting with debugging in ways that make engineering teams much more efficient. A task that might have required fifteen engineers in the past could now be accomplished with only five, aided by LLMs. For someone like me, preparing to enter this field, that is a sobering thought. It suggests that job opportunities could shrink, competition could increase, and the landscape of my profession might change dramatically. While LLMs do not make the job fully autonomous, they undeniably shift the balance of how much human work is required.</p>
            <p>This issue is not just limited to my own career field. I have also noticed the growing dependency on LLMs among students in general. Many of my peers, like myself at first, have learned to rely on them for quick answers. The danger in this is that it prevents students from developing the kind of deep, foundational knowledge that complex topics require. If you don’t fully understand the basics of a subject, it becomes almost impossible to grasp advanced material later on. For example, a student who skips over learning the logic behind algorithms because they rely on LLMs for quick code snippets may find themselves unable to solve more complicated engineering problems down the line. This dependency is like building a house on sand: it might look fine at first, but it is unstable and can collapse when tested.</p>
            <p>Beyond education and careers, another concern that weighs on me is the effect of LLMs on mental health. Increasingly, these tools are being used not just for productivity or academics but for emotional support. People are treating them as friends, confidants, therapists, and even romantic partners. While I understand the appeal—LLMs are always available, non-judgmental, and often programmed to respond in supportive ways—I also believe this is problematic. Machines cannot truly replace human connection, and relying too heavily on them for emotional needs can isolate people further. Real relationships involve complexity, disagreement, and growth. If LLMs replace those experiences, people may lose the skills needed to navigate genuine human interactions. This could have long-term consequences for how people form bonds and maintain community.</p>
            <p>Despite these concerns, I also recognize the benefits and opportunities that LLMs provide. They are powerful tools that can help us achieve levels of efficiency and precision that were previously impossible. In research, for example, LLMs can quickly sort through massive datasets and identify patterns that would take humans months or even years to find. In medicine, they could help doctors analyze complex cases or keep track of emerging research. In business, they can streamline processes, improve customer service, and reduce unnecessary costs. These applications show the potential of LLMs to drive technological progress in meaningful ways. So while I have personal anxieties about what they mean for my own career and society, I cannot deny the promise they hold. My current stance is therefore mixed: cautious but hopeful, worried but curious about what the future may bring.</p>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('outlook')">Outlook &#9660;</h2>
        <div class="content" id="outlook">
            <p>Looking ahead, I believe LLMs will increasingly be viewed as tools that support human effort rather than as technologies that completely take over. I do expect them to keep advancing, but I also think that advancement will eventually hit a plateau. Every technology has limits, and at some point, society will recognize those limits. LLMs will likely become integrated into many aspects of daily life, but in the background rather than in the spotlight. I imagine them quietly supporting everyday tasks—helping with writing, scheduling, analysis, and problem-solving—without being the dominant force people fear today.</p>
            <p>In the corporate world, LLMs will almost certainly be used to increase efficiency and improve personalization. Companies are already experimenting with ways to use them for tailored advertising, individualized product recommendations, and automated customer support. Whether this shift is good or bad will depend largely on how responsibly companies choose to apply the technology. In education, I think classrooms will adapt by weaving LLMs into curricula in ways that encourage deeper engagement rather than surface-level answers. Instead of banning them, teachers may focus on showing students how to use them responsibly, much as schools had to adapt when calculators first became widely available.</p>
            <p>This outlook reminds me of other major technological shifts, like the dot-com era. At first, the internet seemed overwhelming and full of potential threats to jobs, communication, and education. Over time, though, it settled into a balance: it changed the world in major ways, but it didn’t replace people entirely. I believe LLMs will follow a similar path. They will transform industries and daily life, but they will ultimately be viewed as another landmark tool rather than as a force that takes over everything.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('ethics')">Ethical Considerations &#9660;</h2>
        <div class="content" id="ethics">
            <p>Still, the ethical challenges remain serious. I am particularly concerned about the ways LLMs affect communication. Too many people are now turning to them for relationship advice or emotional guidance, treating them less like tools and more like family members. This blurring of boundaries is troubling because it weakens human-to-human interaction and encourages unhealthy dependencies.</p>
            <p>Equally concerning is the role of LLMs in spreading misinformation. Fake videos, images, and articles are already circulating online, and they are often indistinguishable from real content. People can form strong opinions or even take harmful actions based on false information generated by AI. This has huge implications for politics, culture, and even global stability. The speed and scale at which misinformation can spread through AI-generated content makes it one of the most pressing ethical challenges of our time.</p>
            <p>These issues highlight a tension at the heart of LLM development: while the technology itself is neutral, its uses are not. The same model that can help a doctor diagnose a patient can also be used to create harmful propaganda. The same system that can support a student’s learning can also enable academic dishonesty. This duality makes it clear that the ethical questions surrounding LLMs cannot be separated from how they are used by people and institutions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 onclick="toggleSection('future')">Future Ethical Evolutions &#9660;</h2>
        <div class="content" id="future">
            <p>As LLMs evolve, society will need to answer difficult ethical questions. How much personal information should we trust them with? Should they be allowed to play roles in sensitive fields like defense, healthcare, or education? Where do we draw the line between personalization that is helpful and personalization that becomes manipulative or discriminatory? These are not abstract questions—they will shape the rules and boundaries of LLM use in the coming years.</p>
            <p>Privacy will almost certainly become one of the central issues. Already, we live in a world where personal data is constantly being collected, analyzed, and sold. LLMs have the ability to take that personalization to a new level, tailoring not just advertisements but conversations, recommendations, and even emotional responses. The question is: how far should that personalization go before it crosses ethical boundaries?</p>
            <p>Another issue is the expansion of LLMs into areas of life where mistakes can have life-and-death consequences. If these models are used in medicine, how much responsibility should they carry for diagnoses or treatment suggestions? If they are used in defense, what guardrails should be in place to prevent harm? These are the kinds of ethical evolutions that will emerge as the technology becomes more powerful and more embedded in our lives.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the future of LLMs will not be determined by the technology alone but by the values society chooses to uphold. If we prioritize transparency, fairness, and human well-being, LLMs could serve as tools that enhance our lives in remarkable ways. If we neglect these ethical concerns, however, they could contribute to inequality, manipulation, and a loss of trust.</p>
